One shape and one corresponding record exists for each individual transit route.

The line work for the dataset was derived from MRCC Street Centerlines and NCompass Centerlines for Sherburne and Wright County areas.

route:       A number identifying the route number associated with the route and 
             its schedules.

routesort:   A numeric field identifying the route number associated with the
             route and its schedules

Routedescription (routedscrp): A brief description of the route.

routetype:     A description of the type of route.  
     
             1 - Routes that provide a connecting link between urban
               local routes, and many times serve as suburban circulators.
             2 - Routes that are radial, crosstown and limited stop 
               services which primarily operate in the center cities.
             3 - Routes that provide peak and all-day service traveling 
               non-stop on highways for four or more miles. (THIS FIELD IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED IN SCHEDULING SOFTWARE AND WILL RETIRE BY END OF 2022).

RouteClass: a description of the route classification per the Metropolitan Council's Transportation Policy Plan (TPP).


RouteOperator (route_oper): A description of the operator of the route.  'M' values represent
               routes are operated by Metro Transit. 'P' values represent routes not
               operated by Metro Transit.  'MP' values represent routes operated by
               Metro Transit and another transit provider.

EffectiveDate (effectived): The pick date

payleavedirectionid (payleavedi):  The direction of a route where customers are required to pay when exiting the bus rather than boarding.

routepayleave (routepayle): Routes where customers pay fare when exiting the bus rather than boarding

twelvecolor (twelvecolo): An internal code used for cartographic dispalay

*_ftrip: The first trip time served by route at the the routes first stop per service period (Weekday, Saturday, Sunday)

*_ltrip: The last trip time served by route at the routes last stop per service period (Weekday, Saturday, Sunday)

*_span: The span of service by route in hours and mintues</eaover></overview></eainfo><distinfo><resdesc>TransitRoutes</resdesc><distliab>NOTICE:  The Geographic Information System (GIS) Data to which this notice is attached are made available pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13).
